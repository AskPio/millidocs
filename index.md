# Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff!

Oh right. I forgot about the battle. Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? But existing is basically all I do! No! Don't jump!

Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! __Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that!__ *There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo!* Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.

## Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.

Kif might! I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!

1. And why did 'I' have to take a cab?
2. Soothe us with sweet lies.
3. Shut up and get to the point!

### Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute.

Bender?! You stole the atom. Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo.

* We don't have a brig.
* I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!
* File not found.

Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?

Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat. Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun!

Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." Look, last night was a mistake. Look, last night was a mistake. I'll get my kit! I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.

Kif might! These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. Bender, quit destroying the universe! Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor.

That's not soon enough! Kif might! My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.

Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! Take me to your leader! Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.

I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. Ooh, name it after me! Also Zoidberg. Your best is an idiot! Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat.

I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!

I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"!

Oh yeah, good luck with that. Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.

Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?
